## üëã About Guild.so

Guild.so is an open-source self-hosted team management solution.

A guild is a group of people who are on a mission to complete a common goal. Your team is your guild, and this self-hosted solution will put the simplicity back into organizing a team.

Guild.so is a simple dashboard of company announcements, team member availability, and team member status. Keeping it simple, because managing your "management system" shouldn't be a task in itself.

## üî® Installation

Guild.so is based on Laravel 8 and Jetstream so you can run it just like a standard Laravel application. Here are 2 ways of running Guild.so:

## üíô Running on DigitalOcean App Platform

We utilize the ["Deploy to DigitalOcean" Button](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/app-platform/how-to/add-deploy-do-button) to deploy to the App Platform:

[![Deploy to DO](https://mp-assets1.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/deploy-to-do/do-btn-blue.svg)](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/apps/new?repo=https://github.com/guildso/guild/tree/main&refcode=dc19b9819d06)

> **NOTE: This repository contains a pre-generated application key stored in the `.do/deploy.template.yaml` YAML file. During the deployment make sure to generate a new App Key and use it instead of the dummy value!**

### ‚òÅ DigitalOcean Spaces

You can utilize the DigitalOcean Spaces to store your static file uploads like profile pictures and etc.

In order to use Spaces make sure to add the following ENV variables:

```
DO_SPACES=true
DO_SPACES_KEY=YOUR_DO_SPACES_KEY
DO_SPACES_SECRET=YOUR_DO_SPACES_SECRET
DO_SPACES_ENDPOINT=YOUR_DO_SPACES_ENDPOINT
DO_SPACES_REGION=YOUR_DO_SPACES_REGION
DO_SPACES_BUCKET=YOUR_DO_SPACES_BUCKET
```

That way if you deploy to the DigitalOcean App platform, your uplodas will be stored to a persistant volume so you won't loose then during the next deploy.

## ‚úä Manual Installation

You can use the LaraSail script to get your Linux server ready for Laravel 8:

https://github.com/thedevdojo/larasail

Once your server is up and running use `git clone` to clone the repositry and do a standard Laravel installation:

* Create a Database:

During the installation we need to use a MySQL database. You will need to create a new database and save the credentials for the next step.

* Update the `.env` file

Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and update your Database details in there:

```
APP_URL=http://guild.test

DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=guild
DB_USERNAME=guild
DB_PASSWORD=guild_password
```

* Composer Install

```
composer install
```

* Install the NPM dependencies:

```
npm install && npm run dev
```

* Migrate Database

```
php artisan migrate
```
